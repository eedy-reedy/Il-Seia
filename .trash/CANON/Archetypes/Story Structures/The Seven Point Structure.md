The seven point story structure is a useful narrative structure, and identifies seven key points of storytelling.

Like many of the structures on this list, it follows the three act structure, but is a different way of looking at it.

### The 7 Steps of the Seven Point Story Structure

1. **The hook:** while getting to know the protagonist and the environment in which they live, there should be something at the beginning to hook the reader and get them interested in learning more.
2. **Plot point one:** then something unexpected happens, the inciting incident, which pushes the character outside of their comfort zone into an unfamiliar world.
3. **Pinch point one:** the character comes into conflict with the antagonist, and the main purpose of the protagonist is revealed.
4. **Midpoint:** in this step, the character takes full responsibility for the quest, and begins stepping up to take action.
5. **Pinch point two:** but with further conflict with the antagonist, the character reaches rock-bottom and it seems that all hope is lost.
6. **Plot point two:** the protagonist finds new knowledge or assets to help them succeed.
7. **Resolution:** the climax happens, everything is resolved, and the protagonist either does or doesn't achieve their goal.

### When to Use the Seven Point Plot Structure

The seven point plot structure is useful for people writing by the seat of their pants. It gives you clear milestones to shoot for with each point, but doesn't restrict you as much as other plotting systems.

That said, the seven point plot system follows the three act structure fairly closely, so it is a useful plotting method for anyone who wants to give it a try.
