In today's age, the three act structure has permeated our culture, largely thanks to Hollywood which uses a three act structure in almost every film they produce.

Furthermore, you will notice that many (though not all) of the structures on my list use some variation of the three act structure.

It is another basic framework that we would all benefit from familiarizing ourselves with.

Each act is further broken down into three steps, for a total of nine. Let's take a look at those.

### The Nine Steps of the Three Act Structure

**Act I: Set up**

1. **Exposition:** establish an “ordinary world, or a moment when the status quo is normal
2. **Inciting incident:** throw in an event that starts the flow of the story
3. **Plot point 1:** by now, the protagonist has decided to deal with the conflict. Across the “threshold,” and we move into Act 2.

**Act II: Confrontation**

4. **Rising action:** the hero is beset with various challenges that increased the stakes in the tension.
5. **Midpoint:** one event in particular turns everything on its head, and nearly ruins the protagonist's chances of achieving their goal.
6. **Plot point 2:** following the midpoint, the main character fails at a challenge, throwing everything into jeopardy, and questioning whether the protagonist is capable of succeeding.

**Act III: Resolution**

7. **Pre-climax:** there is a moment before the final climax of the story where the main character pulls themselves together and prepares for the final confrontation.
8. **Climax:** this is the final confrontation with the antagonist or main source of conflict, usually ending with (but not always) a success on the protagonist's part.
9. **Dénouement:** all loose ends are neatly tied, and the consequences of the climax are clearly spelled out.

### When to Use 3 Act Structure

The 3 act structure is one of the most common structures in all of storytelling, particularly in modern times. As such, you should definitely familiarize yourself with it for virtually all types of storytelling.

There are exceptions when you might want to look at other structures, such as the 5 act structure or Freytag's Pyramid (useful for tragedies), otherwise most of the structures on this list adhere to the three act structure.
