### Race & Ethnicity

- **What are the chief races in the culture?**
	- Although there are no chief races in Druil culture, the subraces of tree [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] are often given more respect due to their unique ability to [[Petrification|petrify]].
- **What are the chief ethnic groups of each race in the culture? How are they distributed in place?**
	- The chief ethnic groups of Druil culture are most often the group with the oldest line of ancestry in their area.
- **How do they differ by language, appearance, or ancestry?**
	- All sages speak the [[Druil Language|Druil]] language. Their [[Generic (Alves)|alf]] ancestry plays influence in their appearance, favoring long and slender features, large eyes, and sharp ears. The most variable traits among [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] are their antlers (possessed only by tree [[Generic (Sages)|sages]]), which are nearly unique to the individual, and their skin color, which ranges on the spectrum of autumn leaves and is genetically inherited.
- **What jobs do the chief ethnicities primarily occupy? Are any groups denied work because of racial or ethnic heritage?**
	- Although Druil culture claims general equity, it is not uncommon for tree [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] to take positions of higher respect due to their social privilege. These positions are generally political and religious.
- **What are typical attitudes of the native (or majority) ethnos to immigrants and other ethnicities?**
	- Druil culture is highly conformant; racial and ethnic segregation is common among nearly every existing Druil culture. Despite this, discrimination is not common, so long as there is little interchange between its racial and ethnic groups.
- **How has any variety of ethnicity changed the society's culture?**
	- The contrast between Druil culture's vast ethnic diversity against its stubborn segregation has created a unique scenario akin to a false utopia, in which society functions efficiently on a widely accepted system. Most [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] see little issue with this segregation, and may even go so far as to encourage it.
### Family

- **How many spouses may a man or woman have?**
	- Because Druil culture is [[The Trinity|Trinity]]-observant, relationships of three are often considered stable and sacred. Despite this, monogamy is considered simpler and thus is equally practiced. There is no gendered privilege, as Druil culture is not inherently patriarchal or matriarchal.
- **Who decides on a marriage?**
	- Druil culture is fairly unrestrictive within its ethnic groups; [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] have the freedom to choose their own partners.
- **Can a marriage end in divorce? How?**
	- Freedom in forming relationships also provides freedom in ending relationships. It is the duty of a Druil priest to both join and separate a marriage.
- **Who usually takes custody of children if a marriage ends for some reason?**
	- The mother is wholly responsible for her children in Druil culture, and will take custody of them following a divorce.
- **How is adultery defined? What (if any) is the punishment? Who decides?**
	- Adultery is only defined as infidelity with a *married* partner. Preceding marriage, [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] are encouraged to explore themselves and court as many others as they'd like before settling on a long-term partner
- **How are families named?**
	- Druil culture does not feature family names; each [[Generic (Sages)|sage]] is instead given their own unique *primary* and *formal* name
- **What happens to orphans?**
	- With the inherent transience of Druil relationships, it is not uncommon for children to be abandoned upon their parents' separation. Druil orphanages are sprawling and all too often mismanaged.
- **How are boy and girl children treated differently?**
	- Druil gender roles are very traditional: men play the roles of providers, whereas women play the role of caretakers. Because of this, Druil boyhood values strength and integrity, and Druil girlhood values service and dignity. Youthful beauty is upheld among both genders equally. 
- **What, if anything, is considered a good marriage gift?**
	- Gifts of life are Druil's main form of gift-giving. Offering plants of religious significance signify a trust placed in the recipient to cultivate life. Marriage gifts follow this same principle.
- **What inanimate or sexless things are considered male or female?**
- **Does this society connect the ideas of marriage with love?**
	- Before anything else, marriage is an act of love. The legal and religious significance of marriages are deeply based in a couple's love for each other.
- **How big are families, typically?**
	- Druil families are often small, emphasizing the emotional bond between one child and their parents rather than the propagation of the next generation.
- **What constitutes a household? How many people live in one household? How many generations?**
	- It is not uncommon for a family to remain in their ancestral home for their entire lives. In this way, households will span across generations, growing quite large to account for their rather low birth rates. 
- **Are girls or boys preferred? Why?**
	- There is no preference in Druil culture for male or female children; both are equally valued in Druil culture, and both are of equal maintenance.
- **How common is domestic violence? Is it understood to be a problem, or a normal aspect of family life?**
	- Peaceful by nature, [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] are highly non-violent in their relationships. Causing harm to life in any form is a deep Druil taboo.

- **If two women get into a fight, how should that be resolved?**
- **How do people demonstrate grief?**
	- Grieving [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] often vow silence for a brief time, during which they gather memories and artifacts of those who passed. These artifacts are often used to decorate the [[Druil Lost Forests (Nathein Sulada)|lost forests]] of Druil culture.
- **Who inherits property? Titles? Position?**
	- Material property is generally inherited by the firstborn of a family and does not discriminate based on gender. Although titles and positions of leadership are not inherited, there is a degree of privilege possessed by a leader's heirs during new elections.
- **What are the most popular games? How important are they?**
	- 
- **How do people react to physical deformity?**
	- Despite being the children of a magical deformity, [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] are highly purist. Physical deformity is seen as the fault of the individual, often as punishment for their misdeeds in a past life.
- **When and how does someone go from child to adult?**
	- [[Generic (Sages)|Sages]] finish maturing at 18 years of age, and the transition from childhood to adulthood is recognized at the same time. To complete this transition, [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] perform a meditative coming of age ritual, or [[Druil Coming of Age (Etava)|Etava]], during which they spend a week among the ritual gardens of a Druil [[Druil Temple (Runa)|runa]]. They are not allowed to eat physical food during this time, instead semi-fasting on a diet of pure photosynthesis. The ritual requires incredible mental endurance, and is meant to prepare [[Generic (Sages)|sages]] for the trials of adulthood.
- **How much free time to people usually get? What do they spend this time doing?**
	- [[Generic (Sages)|Sages]] live a robust life; much of each day is devoted to work. The sparse moments of free time in Druil culture are devoted to building romantic relationships and pursuing fine arts.
