The Iron Age involves the adoption of iron smelting technology. It general replaced bronze, and makes it possible to produce tools which are stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. In many cultures, the Iron Age is the last major step before the development of written language, however this is not universally the case. It is not possible to mass manufacture steel because high furnace temperatures are needed, but steel can be produced by forging bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a controllable way. Iron ores are much more widespread than either copper or tin. Large hill forts are built either as a refuge in time of war, or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age are expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increases, providing more farmland to support the growing population.
