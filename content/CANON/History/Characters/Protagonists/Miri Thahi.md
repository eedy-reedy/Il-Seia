	- [[Type 7 - The Enthusiast]]
		- **Basic Fear:** Of being deprived and in pain
		- **Basic Desire:** To be satisfied and content—to have their needs fulfilled
		- **Key Motivations:** Want to maintain their freedom and happiness, to avoid missing out on worthwhile experiences, to keep themselves excited and occupied, to avoid and discharge pain.
		- **Level 5:** Unable to discriminate what they really need, become hyperactive, unable to say "no" to themselves, throwing self into constant activity. Uninhibited, doing and saying whatever comes to mind: storytelling, flamboyant exaggerations, witty wise-cracking, performing. Fear being bored: in perpetual motion, but do too many things—many ideas but little follow through.
