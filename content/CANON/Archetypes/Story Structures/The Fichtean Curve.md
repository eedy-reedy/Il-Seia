The Fichtean Curve is a classic story structure that make up almost every story. It is represented by a skewed triangle, and contains three basic parts: rising action, climax, and falling action.

### The 3 Steps of the Fichtean Curve

1. **Rising action:** this is the primary part of your story, and will take up most of your time. Rising action is punctuated by several crises, each of which heighten the stakes, progress your plot, and increased attention. This is why it is called rising action.
2. **The climax:** at the top of your rising action, everything cumulates into a single climax, where every threat of your novel converges. This is near the End of your novel, at the height of tension.
3. **Falling action:** after your climax, you need some time to let the reader relax, and we do this with falling action. This section allows you to tie up any loose ends of your story, and show your characters returning to a state of normalcy.

### When to Use the Fichtean Curve

The Fichtean Curve is so basic that it can be used in virtually every story. You will find that nearly every other story structure on my list uses this basic framework of rising action, climax, and falling action.

And so it is necessary for you, the author, to understand these basic principles and make sure they are incorporated into every story you write, because missing these basic elements will not result in a story most people want to read.
