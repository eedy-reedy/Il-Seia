Another popular story structure was made famous by author and screenwriter Blake Snyder, and is a more detailed version of the 3 act structure.

While Blake Snyder was originally writing for screenwriters, and his Save the Cat beat sheet even has page numbers assigned, so you know exactly how many pages of a screenplay you should write, it still works for novelists as well.

### The 15 Steps of the “Save the Cat” Formula

1. **Opening image:** your story should start out with a brief look at the main character, the overall feel and tone of the story, etc.
2. **Set up:** from here we get a little more exposition, setting up the tone of the world, introducing us to characters, etc.
3. **Theme stated:** somewhere inside the set up, it should be made clear what the theme is. This may not be understood by the main character yet, but it will become more and more obvious as the story progresses.
4. **Catalyst:** following all of the set up, we have the inciting incident and the story starts rolling.
5. **Debate:** like the “refusal of the call” in the hero's journey, there are moments when the protagonist fights or debates with the path that they have taken.
6. **Break into two:** at this point we move into act two of the story, and the main character is fully invested in their quest.
7. **B story**: every good story also has some kind of subplot, such as a romance that is happening at the same time as the primary plot. At this point, we are introduced to this subplot.
8. **Fun and games:** before the goings get tough, the protagonist has a small amount of time to enjoy the new life that they are living, the new world they are in, the new abilities they have gained, etc.
9. **Midpoint:** but then something big happens, and it completely turns the protagonists goals on their head.
10. **Bad guys close in:** here, the antagonistic forces become a greater threat to the protagonist, the tension is raised, the conflict increases, etc.
11. **All is lost:** then, something happens to the protagonist. They face a dark time, they lose a friend or mentor, or are otherwise put under extreme duress
12. **Dark night of the soul:** the protagonist goes through a depressive period, when it seems that all hope is lost.
13. **Break into three:** now we move into act three, where the protagonist is able to jump up from rock-bottom and gain a key piece of knowledge that will help them in the future.
14. **Finale:** this is where everything culminates. The character takes everything that they have learned and gained over the course of the story and puts it to use in order to eliminate the antagonist.
15. **Final image:** this is a final snapshot of your story, and it should mirror or “rhyme” with the opening snapshot. In the hero's journey, this is the return.

### When to Use Save the Cat

The Save the Cat framework is ideal for writers of film and television, although many of these ideas are applicable to novelists as well.

If you want to use this in a novel, you will have to adapt the page count of each beat to your own story, but you can make it work.
