The five act structure is basically the same as Freytag’s Pyramid, following the same basic steps:

### The 5 Steps of the Five Act Structure

6. **Exposition:** We establish the ordinary world and basic setup of the plot.
7. **Rising action:** a series of events as the protagonist pursues their goal.
8. **Climax:** everything converges into the point of no return.
9. **Falling action:** the consequences of the hero’s decisions thus far.
10. **Resolution or catastrophe:** final resolutions where the hero is at the highest or lowest point of the story.

### When to Use the 5 Act Structure

Like Freytag’s Pyramid, the 5 Act Structure is best used in works inspired by classical writing, such as the works of Homer or Shakespeare.

However, while Freytag’s Pyramid is primarily for tragedies, the five act structure can also be adapted for less-tragic stories, such as comedies. For example, Shakespeare’s comedies also follow the five-act structure, which is kind of an inverse of the tragedy whilst maintaining the same structure.
