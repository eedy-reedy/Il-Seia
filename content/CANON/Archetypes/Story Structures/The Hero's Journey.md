The hero's journey is one of the most popular forms of story structure, made popular by Joseph Campbell in his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_, which identified several unique steps used in almost any heroic story, common in mythology.

This framework was later adapted by Christopher Vogler in his book, _The Writer's Journey_, which boil down the hero's journey into 12 steps:

### The 12 Steps of the Hero's Journey

**Part 1: Departure**

1. **The ordinary world:** we establish the place of comfort for the hero.
2. **The call of adventure:** this is similar to the inciting incident, where the hero is given a reason to go on an adventure.
3. **Refusal of the call**: at first, the hero is reluctant to answer the call to action.
4. **Meeting the mentor:** in almost every hero's journey, there is a wise mentor who gives the hero knowledge, or otherwise prepares them for what is ahead.
5. **Crossing the 1st threshold:** the hero steps outside of their comfort zone, and the main plot begins. In a 3 act structure, this would be the end of act one.

**Part 2: Initiation**

1. **Tests, allies, enemies:** the hero faces increasingly difficult challenges, but also gains allies against the new enemies.
2. **Approach to the inmost cave:** the hero approaches their goal, but we are still uncertain of the outcome.
3. **The ordeal:** this is a huge challenge that the hero overcomes.
4. **Reward (seizing the sword):** as a result of overcoming the previous challenge, the hero gets some kind of boon or a reward to help them in the future.

**Part 3: The Return**

1. **The road back:** at this point, the hero has achieved their goal, but the end is not yet. The hero may even discover that what they achieved may have made things worse.
2. **Resurrection:** the hero faces their greatest challenge, the climax of the entire story, where everything they have learned so far comes together.
3. **Return with the elixir:** this is similar to falling action, where all of the loose ends are tied up, and the hero returns to their ordinary world with new experiences.

### When to Use the Hero's Journey

The hero's journey is best used for heroic narratives, or when you have a hero that must accomplish some great thing, and grow in the process.

That said, the basic structure of the hero's journey works for a variety of stories and genres, even though they are most commonly used in fantasy, science fiction, and superhero narratives. Because, if you think about it, every protagonist is the hero of their own story, so you can use the hero's journey there.

Simply adapting these steps to your genre can easily make a mythically-resonant novel.
