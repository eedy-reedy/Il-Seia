In Medias Res is Latin for “in the middle of things”. This plotting framework runs on the idea that you should start your story immediately at the start of conflict, dropping the reader into the action without warning.

Think of _Star Wars: A New Hope_, which drops us right into a conflict between the Empire and the Rebels. We know nothing about this conflict, but learn more as the movie progresses.

In truth, In Medias Res is more of a tactic than a storytelling structure, but it does have some key points to follow.

### The Six Steps of In Medias Res

1. **In Medias Res:** we start off immediately into the action, with little to no exposition or backstory.
2. **Rising action:** the conflict increases, the characters are forced to adjust, and the tension is heightened over time. By this point the reader should be invested in the characters, but still not know everything that is going on yet.
3. **Explanation:** layered throughout rising action, at key “rest” points, you can layer in exposition and backstory to inform the reader of what is going on.
4. **Climax:** as with the three act structure, the climax is where everything comes together in the characters either succeed or fail.
5. **Falling action:** following the climax, all loose ends are tied up in the reader is allowed to breathe.
6. **Resolution**: the character returns to their ordinary world, and all remaining plot threads are addressed.

### When to Use In Medias Res

This is a difficult question, as you can use In Medias Res in a variety of ways. Overall, you should try to start your novel as close to the conflict as possible, but there are multiple ways to do this. You don't necessarily need to start with the inciting incident.

The point is to immediately hook your readers and pull them through the story, which In Medias Res allows you to do.

Regardless of whether you are intentionally using In Medias Res as a story structure, we highly recommend you do everything you can to immediately pull your readers into the story.
