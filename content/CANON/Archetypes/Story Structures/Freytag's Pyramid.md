Freytag's Pyramid is one of the oldest story structures ever identified. It was invented by Gustav Freytag in the 1800s, and focuses primarily on the structure of classical literature and tragedies such as those written by Shakespeare, a.k.a. the most popular literature of the time.

Some will debate whether there are 5 or 7 steps to Freytag's Pyramid, but the original work only included 5, so let's start with those:

### The 5 Steps of Freytag's Pyramid

1. **Exposition:** at this point, we establish the status quo, and explain the starting situation. The step ends with the inciting incident.
2. **Rising action:** just like in the Fichtean Curve, rising action features the main character pursuing their goal while the stakes heighten.
3. **Climax:** this is a moment in the center of your story that acts as the point of no return.
4. **Falling action:** we see the consequences of the climax and the decisions that the protagonist has faced so far. In a tragedy, falling action is when we see things start to spiral out of control.
5. **Resolution or catastrophe:** in the final step, everything is tied up, and the character reaches their lowest point (if you are writing a tragedy).

### When to Use Freytag's Pyramid

Freytag's Pyramid is best used when writing tragedies, or other works heavily inspired by classical literature. It, like the 5 act structure, is less common in modern-day works, but can still be really useful for the right type of story.
