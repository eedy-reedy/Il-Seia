# PLOT

## prelude - chill shit

- Notes
- Hymn to Paphia is set in Hiraeth, in a distant future laden with fallen civilization atop fallen civilization. The world is post-apocalyptic, and Hiraeth swarms with scavengers trying to stay alive in the icy wilderness. Two of these scavengers are a couple: Harness and “Tori” Anactoria
- Harness and Tori live a simple, cyclical life, with Harness going out scavenging every day and Tori tending to Harness’ wounds and repairing her prosthetic arm when she returns
	- Their love life is strong, and their sex life too, but through it Harness feels she is wearing a persona. Harness abused a previous partner and is filled with shame and self-hatred for it. She believes she will lose Tori if the truth about her past comes out, so she assumes a persona to protect Tori
		- We don’t know this yet, though. Harness admits that she is trying to do better for Tori, but does not yet divulge what she did wrong
	- The intimate moments between them are when the reader learns the most about Tori and her motivations. Tori was a child of constant struggle and neglect, and as such has learned to cling tight to every little moment of stability. This includes her love life with Harness, who Tori believes she can “fix” by keeping Harness within arms’ reach. This means encouraging her to spend less time scavenging
		- Unfortunately, Harness’ first instinct when she is faced with emotional pain is to isolate herself, straying deeper into the wilderness to reconcile with her thoughts
