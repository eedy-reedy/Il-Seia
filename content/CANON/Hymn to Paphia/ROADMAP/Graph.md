She is always analyzing the environment for threats, and for resources<br>    <br>- She thinks about the mistakes she’s made, and how she’ll do better this time<br>    <br><br>- Harness is hopeful. She reflects on the comfort she finds in solitude, and how she feels she is becoming better for Anactoria |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They start to flirt as they do it<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Peak:<br><br>- Harness pushes herself onto Tori and the two share a long, passionate kiss. Tori suggests they move somewhere more intimate<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Release<br><br>- They begin to transition to a more intimate space, and Harness reflects on the persona she has been using to charm Tori                                                                                                             | Thoughts/Feelings:<br><br>- Harness is thinking about how to control the situation at all times–this will be a recurring theme<br>    <br><br>- While Tori is infatuated with Harness’ persona, Harness feels an emotional disconnect. Her insistence on a persona as a way to forget her past has lead to a sense of depersonalization                                 | Thoughts/Feelings:<br><br>- Tori is naturally concerned for Harness, but accepts that the cycle of scavenging is the life they’ve been forced to lead<br>    <br><br>- She is deeply in love with Harness’ persona. As far as she knows, the vibrant, sarcastic, mysterious Harness is the woman she loves |
| 3 - Day 1<br><br>  <br><br>Smut time! Harness and Tori move to their lean-to tent, placed against a stone wall<br><br>  <br><br>It is evening | Establish:<br><br>- Harness takes in the beauty of Tori’s body. Tori is excitedly awaiting her<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Initiate:<br><br>- Harness begins with foreplay, pressing Tori against the stone wall. This is a mirror image of the way she will later force Haithali into intimacy<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Peak:<br><br>- Harness gets Tori to climax, and as it happens Harness overpowers her completely. This is a glimpse of what Harness really desires from intimacy–control<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>Release<br><br>- Tori tells Harness to calm down and Harness complies, and aftercare begins. From there, Tori gives her concerns about Harness going off on her own so much. Harness invites Tori to join her, and Tori reluctantly agrees | Thoughts/Feelings:<br><br>- It’s evident that Harness truly loves Tori, even if she doesn’t know how to express it<br>    <br>- Harness’ true self comes out in her most intimate moments. She wants control, innocently or not, and she will have it                                                                                                                   | Thoughts/Feelings:<br><br>- Tori, infatuated by Harness’ charm, loves it when Harness takes control of the situation. She loses herself in the moment, but when it’s over she cannot help but feel bittersweet, as these moments between them are so often interrupted by Harness’ isolation               |

# PLOT POINT ONE

- Notes
	- Haithali is thrown into the mixture
	- Harness sees herself in Haithali and feels more comfortable being authentic. This leads to a lack of restraint/temperance on Harness’ part, as she tries to make advances on what she thinks is newfound love but Haithali is closing herself off. Harness wants love, Haithali wants friendship
