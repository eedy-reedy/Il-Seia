- **Personality Type (Enneagram)**
	- [[Type 9 - The Peacemaker]]
		- **Basic Fear:** Of loss and separation
		- **Basic Desire:** To have inner stability "peace of mind"
		- **Key Motivations:** Want to create harmony in their environment, to avoid conflicts and tension, to preserve things as they are, to resist whatever would upset or disturb them.
		- **Level 5:** Active, but disengaged, unreflective, and inattentive. Do not want to be affected, so become unresponsive and complacent, walking away from problems, and "sweeping them under the rug." Thinking becomes hazy and ruminative, mostly comforting fantasies, as they begin to "tune out" reality, becoming oblivious. Emotionally indolent, unwillingness to exert self or to focus on problems: indifference.
